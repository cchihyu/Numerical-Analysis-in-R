interpï¼› Find the new location of Interpolating with a set of points.
find.max.error: Find the maximum error of interpolation.

## Numerical differentiation and integration
### diff
diff: Numerical differentiation with input function, location, and tolerance. 
f and g: Two sample functions.
### integration
simpinteg: Numerical integration using the Simpson method. Inputs are function, start, end, and number of blocks.
f: A sample function.

## Root finding
